# MovieVerse

This project is a place where you can search info about movies and add them to a favourite list. 

MovieVerse was made with React and Sass, including semantic HTML and including some functionalities like dark mode. Vite was used to build the project.

The project doesn't use a database to persist the favourite movies list, localStorage is used instead.

Movie data was provided by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org)
